Right now, AI is smart. But it’s still bland.

It knows facts. It knows steps. But it doesn’t know why something feels off.

Ask it to design a page? You’ll get something that works. Not something that wows.

Because taste isn’t data. It’s instinct. It’s culture. It’s context. And right now, AI doesn’t have a gut.

But that’s changing.

Every time we rate an image, pick a color, edit a sentence—we’re training it. Quietly. At scale.

Soon, it won’t just guess what should work. It’ll know what feels right—for you.

You’ll say: “I want Apple’s polish, Stripe’s clarity, and a hint of play.”
And it’ll get it. Not just the layout, but the feeling.

That’s taste.

Not rules. Not templates. Just good, clean instinct—on demand.

It’s not perfect yet. But it’s learning.

And when it finally clicks?

Taste won’t just be personal. It’ll be programmable.
