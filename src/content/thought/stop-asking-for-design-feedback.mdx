They’re not your user.
They don’t care.

You ask,
**“what do you think of the design?”**

They say, **“Looks clean.”** or **“How about this feature or color?”**

I made this mistake too. (*I still do. that's why I’m writing this.*)

You don’t need feedback.
You need signals.

Now I:
- Watch real people use it. (*Mixpanel, Hotjar, etc.*)
- See where they pause. 
- See what they ignore. (*Educate them or remove it.*)
- See where they quit.

That’s your feedback. It took me a while to learn this. I still ask for feedback. **But I’m learning to ask the right questions.**

import { EndCTA } from "@components/cta";

<EndCTA
  title={`Can’t find a team that gets your vision? We do.`}
  cta_label="Book a call"
  bg_colour="cyan"
/>
