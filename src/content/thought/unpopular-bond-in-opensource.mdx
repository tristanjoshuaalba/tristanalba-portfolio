Saw this open source project on GitHub last night. Looked neat, so I cloned it, added a feature, submitted a pull request. Woke up today, some strangers had improved my code! We don't know each other but building together. That's the beauty of open source.

<EndCTA
	title={`Feeling stuck?, We've helped countless businesses just like yours!`}
	cta_label='Book a call'
	bg_colour='yellow'
/>
