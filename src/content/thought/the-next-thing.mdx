**Why do I feel so stuck?**

I’ve been stuck before. Looking at a long list of tasks on linear, apple reminders, not knowing where to start. Everything feels important. Everything feels urgent.

But here’s what I’ve learned from a random Instagram video: **I don’t need to do it all. I just need to do the next most important thing.**

That’s it.

When I feel stuck, I look at my list and ask:

**What’s the next most important thing I can do right now?**

I don’t mean the easiest thing or the thing that feels good to check off. I mean the thing that actually matters. The one thing that, if I finish it, will make the biggest difference.

It’s usually not the thing I want to do. Sometimes it’s hard. Sometimes it’s boring. But when I focus on that one thing, I make progress.

When I try to do everything? I get nowhere.

Now I take a deep breath, look at my list, and ask:
**“What’s the most important thing I can do right now?”**

Once I know, I stop thinking and start working. No multitasking. No distractions. Just that one thing.

And when I finish? I pick the next thing.

It’s not magic, but it works. I don’t feel so stuck anymore.

Again, I repeat.

**You don’t need to do it all. Just start with one.**
