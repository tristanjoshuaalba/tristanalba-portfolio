I don’t believe in prototypes until I see a screenshot.
Mockups lie. Words mislead. Screenshots show the truth.

You can pitch forever.
But a screenshot?

It says: **“I did the thing.”**

It’s the real proof of concept that matters. 


import { EndCTA } from "@components/cta";

<EndCTA
  title={`Want to build something amazing with Generative AI space?, Let's chat!`}
  cta_label="Book a call"
  bg_colour="orange"
/>
