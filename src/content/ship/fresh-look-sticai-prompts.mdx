SticAI prompts page is one of the most important pages on the SticAI. It's where users can find all the prompts to start their AI journey. The old design was cluttered, confusing, and not visually appealing. So, I decided to redesign it.

Old design:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Check out <a href="https://t.co/YS2oucj8rs">https://t.co/YS2oucj8rs</a> for a wide range of prompt collections to generate your content! <a href="https://t.co/2WdyBIJ9s6">pic.twitter.com/2WdyBIJ9s6</a></p>&mdash; Sanju (@spikeysanju) <a href="https://twitter.com/spikeysanju/status/1646177004973064192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

New design:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cut out the noise from <a href="https://twitter.com/SticAIHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sticaihq</a> prompts page. New design is simpler ðŸ¤ŒðŸ’œ <a href="https://t.co/O4E7tcPQLt">pic.twitter.com/O4E7tcPQLt</a></p>&mdash; Sanju (@spikeysanju) <a href="https://twitter.com/spikeysanju/status/1791447479604351417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The new design is more dead simple, visually appealing, and provides a better user experience. It's like a breath of fresh air. I'm excited to see how users react to it.

If you want to check out the new design, head over to [SticAI prompts page](https://app.sticai.com/prompts)

And remember, it's still a work in progress, just like me!


import { EndCTA } from "@components/cta";

<EndCTA
	title={`Need access to SticAI prompts? Let's chat!`}
	cta_label='Book a call'
	bg_colour='purple'
/>
