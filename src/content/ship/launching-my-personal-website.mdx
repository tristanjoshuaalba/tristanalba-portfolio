title: Launching sanju.sh â€“ new personal website
description: 'After countless hours, numerous cups of coffee, and a few existential crises, I finally decided to launch my personal website. Its been a journey of many personal sites that never saw the light of the day, but this time, I decided to ship it. Yes, you heard it right!'

here's tweet i shared about the site:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Built with love, <br />Open sourced with pride. <br />My portfolio&#39;s live! <a href="https://t.co/6RGZU6ZNeO">https://t.co/6RGZU6ZNeO</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZvaPQmB4Wx">pic.twitter.com/ZvaPQmB4Wx</a></p>&mdash; Sanju (@spikeysanju) <a href="https://twitter.com/spikeysanju/status/1789721861846090145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

From now on, without any procrastination (fingers crossed), I can share my thoughts, ideas, and projects with the world. 

It's like a fresh start, a new beginning, a blank canvas waiting to be painted. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me and what new adventures await.

And remember, it's still a work in progress, just like me!

See you in the next ship!
